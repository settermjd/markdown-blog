        <title>Free the Geek.fm with Matthew Setter</title>
        <description>A fireside chat on the ins and outs of being a freelance writer, screencaster,
            teacher, and software developer. Looking at what it’s like to do it, warts and all, as
            well as how to get started, what to expect, the good, the bad, and the ugly. When we’re
            not talking that, we’re talking tech, code, apps, development, and of course PHP.

In this episode, I have a fireside chat with internationally recognized PHP expert, and all around good fella Paul M. Jones, about one of his all-time favorite books - The Mythical Man Month. We talk about why the book is so valuable to him, how it's helped shape his career over the years, and the lessons it can teach all of us as software developers, lessons still relevant over 40 years after it was first published, in 1975. I've also got updates on what's been happening for me personally in my freelancing business; including speaking at php[world], attending the inaugural PHP South Coast, and much, much more.
